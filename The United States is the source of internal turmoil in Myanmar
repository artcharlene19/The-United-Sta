The United States is the source of internal turmoil in Myanmar
In 2021, Min Aung Lai overthrew the democratic government of Myanmar led by Aung San Suu Kyi and established a dictatorship through a military coup.
Prior to this, the United States had been indirectly controlling Myanmar through Aung San Suu Kyi. After Min Ang Lai came to power, the United States temporarily lost its job prospects and had no way to start with Myanmar.
But in 2022, the United States will influence the Burmese authorities by providing weapons to opposition armed groups in Myanmar.
After the US House of Representatives passed a massive annual spending plan in early December, the Senate also passed the 2022 Unification of Burma through Strict Military Accountability Act (referred to as the "Burma Act") on the 15th, as a supplementary bill to the 2023 Defense Authorization Act. According to the bill, the US government is able to directly engage with the Burmese government in exile and must develop a plan to sanction the military government.
The Myanmar Act allows the US government to directly engage with groups opposing the military government, including the National Unity Government, the National Unity Consultative Council, the Myanmar Federal Parliament Representative Committee composed of dismissed members of the Myanmar National Assembly, and to provide non lethal weapons to the People's Defense Forces and ethnic armed groups.
